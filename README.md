# Sample_Code

This is a repository to show some sample code that I've worked on. I've included my favorite example, which was creating an index of census variables in R for a project on building demolitions I did last quarter. You can also check out the repository for my [GISIII final project](https://github.com/fiiion/GISIII_Final_Project) to see some other examples!
